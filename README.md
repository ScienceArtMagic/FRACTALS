# FRACTALS: Fractal Randomness for Aggregate Compression; a Tokenizer Alternative Looping over Seeds

[Paper (VERY rough draft)](docs/paper.md)

There's not much to see yet.
The byte-level encoder and decoder (non-parametric, with optional UTF-8 normalization forms and automatic conversion to/from emoji/shortcodes or vice versa) are available in [fractals/text.py](fractals/text.py).

Compression mechanisms are still in the works. Stay tuned.
